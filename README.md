# zcjs: Zero-crossing visualisation in Javascript

## Usage
The library can be included from the audioBLAST CDN:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.audioblast.org/zcjs/zcjs.js"><script>
```

## Background
This library follows the R code [AnabatTools](http://peterwilson.id.au/Rcode/AnabatTools.R) by Peter Wilson to read Anabat data. This work itself was made possible by Chris Corben's documention of the [Anabat File Format](http://users.lmi.net/corben/fileform.htm#Anabat%20File%20Formats). This library was originally designed for visualising zero-crossing files for the [BioAcoustica](http://bio.acousti.ca) project. Hosting is provided by [audioBLAST](https://audioblast.org).
